# PhraseNet

This is a phrase net implemented as a Shiny application. A phrase net is a visualization tool that represents a text input as a graph. The size of the text represents word frequency, connections between words are displayed as arrows where their directionality and width communicate the flow and strength of connected words. The user can select a custom connection word to be used between the words.
